My name is Judy Chen, and I currently work as a Sales Coordinator at NOOR Events. I support both the sales and events teams in driving revenue through effective client communication, lead management, and seamless coordination of event logistics. Through this role, Iâ€™ve developed strong skills in organization, communication, and working under pressure. Key projects include launching targeted cold-calling and email campaigns, and optimizing internal processes to enhance client experience. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the connection between sales and marketing, while sharpening my ability to engage and manage client relationships across the event life cycle.

As I continue to grow professionally, my goal is to transition into a digital marketing analytics role where I can apply my experience in sales and client engagement to data-driven strategies. I'm particularly interested in roles that combine marketing strategy, consumer insights, and technology to drive measurable business outcomes.
